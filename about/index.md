My name is Oliver. I am a graduate researcher working with Dr. Wayne Getz in the
Environmental Science, Policy, and Management department at UC Berkeley. I am
interested in computational ecology and related projects. Specially, I am extremely
passionate about enhancing accessibility through building software (primarily
browser based) that can dynamically build computational models based on user
specifications and modifications - without requiring users to have a rich background
or expertise in computer programming. The majority of biologists, ecologists, and
other applied researchers and educators find themselves needing tools that require
significant knowledge in at least a few programming languages...which they often
do not have. So I hope some of my work addresses these issues by helping bridge
this knowledge gap.

### Research

I love evolutionary models, evolutionary algorithms, and machine learning.
Some of my interests include how to involve genetic algorithms with mate choice
preferences based on genetic relatedness of individuals. Similarly, I have really
enjoyed my recent work on opportunistic scavenging behavior - involving a
mammalian carnivore opportunistically scavenging on either conspecific (same
species) or interspecific (different species) carcasses. We examined the probability
of monomorphic vs. polymorphic emergences etc. I have been working on developing
the web-side (both client- and server-side - including HPC environments) of the
Nova modeling software. This is a software that is used for dynamical systems,
agent-based, and spatial modeling with a visual and scripting language.   

## Tools

I like Atom from Github as a text editor. I like LaTeX (but it is new for me). I
like web-based / JavaScript data science and visualization (D3js, NodeJS, etc).
I like open source. I like open access. I like progress.
