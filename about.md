My name is Oliver. I am a graduate researcher working with Dr. Wayne Getz in the
Environmental Science, Policy, and Management department at UC Berkeley. I am
interested in computational ecology and related projects.

## What else?

I like bicycling. I like the piano. I like collaborations. I like running.
I probably like computers. I really like birds. 

## Tools

I like Atom from Github as a text editor. I like LaTeX (but it is new for me). I
like web-based / JavaScript data science and visualization (D3js, NodeJS, etc).
I like open source. I like open access. I like progress.
