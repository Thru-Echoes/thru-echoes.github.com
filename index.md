This site will feature projects I am either working on or recently completed.
These projects may involve code from languages such as JavaScript, R, or Python.
In addition, I may include thoughts on concepts relating to the state of modern
science, open access / source, evolution and who knows what else - enjoy!

## What exactly?

I like to use genetic algorithms, machine learning, and other computational methods to address questions in ecology and evolution. In addition, I want to help create software (primarily browser based) that helps those who do not have extensive programming experience be able to use computational tools. I am primarily working on improving the web-based parts of the Nova modeling software - both as client- and server-side environments - to be able to provide researchers and educators a means of building simulations that use components from dynamical systems, spatial, and agent-based modeling paradigms.  

### Tools

I like Atom from Github as a text editor. I like LaTeX (but it is new for me). I
like web-based / JavaScript data science and visualization (D3js, NodeJS, etc).
I like open source. I like open access. I like progress.
