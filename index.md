I am a PhD student at UC Berkeley working on computational ecology - ranging from my involvement with the [PEARL project](http://pearl.berkeley.edu/), mapping global distributions of parasites as functions of climate change, to developing genetic algorithms in order to address ecological-evolutionary questions about monomorphism in mammalian carnivore scavenging behavior. I am very interested in open source & access, data science & visualization, and the stochastic nature of subjective & objective reality. Modelization by random realization.

## My Research and Broader Goals

Very quick here -

* mathematical modeling (agent based, population, disease models)
* web app software development
* machine learning (especially focused on small sample size as most of ecological / environmental science data is)   
* Foxes! Lookup the Channel Island foxes 

### Papers

* [A web app for single- or multi-Population Viability Analysis](papers/getz_muellerklein_pva.pdf)
* [Documenting female song in Puerto Rican Orioles](papers/female_song_pr.pdf)
