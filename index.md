I am a PhD student at UC Berkeley working on computational ecology. I am very interested in open source & access, data science & visualization, the state of modern science, and the stochastic nature of subjective & objective reality. Modelization by random realization.

## My Research and Broader Goals

I like to use genetic algorithms, mathematical modeling, and other computational methods (like machine-learning!) to address questions in ecology and evolution. My big-scale dreams are to help create software (primarily browser-based) aimed at those who do not have extensive programming experience. This may refer to computational software - think R for mathematical modeling - and ecology and other academic researchers, students, or teachers. I am primarily working on improving the web-based parts of the Nova modeling software, both as client- and server-side environments, to be able to provide researchers and educators a means of building simulations that use components from dynamical systems, spatial, and agent-based modeling paradigms.  

### Tools

I like Atom from Github as a text editor. I like LaTeX (but it is new for me). I
like web-based / JavaScript data science and visualization (D3js, NodeJS, etc).
I like open source. I like open access. I like progress.
