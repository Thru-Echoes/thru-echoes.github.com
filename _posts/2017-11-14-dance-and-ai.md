## What is the point of dancing? 

I focus on computational ecology. I believe we can learn lessons from artificial intelligence (in the direction towards conscious robots) to better our own pursuit of knowledge and self-expression as humans. Outside of the simulations and app development (mainly web based) that I do for my academic and consulting based work, I am an extremely passionate dancer. My style of dance originates from popping, isolation, and ticking (if those words do not ring a bell you can sort of think of it as "hip-hop dance"). However, I incorporate a heavy focus on / influence from a new breed of visual and auditory movement that I call glitching. Glitching, where the body mimics the sort of glitches you may see in a computer from some bug(s) in code, is a reflection of the age of technological singularity. Further, glitch dancing is how I capture and further understand what we as humans are experiencing and being shaped by within this new reality and our pursuit of universal truth in this time. 

## Exploring self and improving Science

I interpret myself (self-exploration and introspection) and my pursuit of knowledge through computational methods directly and indirectly through dance. This has completely revolutionized my outlook on the scientific method and scientific research (including discovering many pitfalls of modern science and the very bubbled / unrealistic nature of academic research). Academic research, and primarily the natural sciences, for the most part is lacking a connection with the exploration of culture, self, and what it means to be human in the age of post-human development (i.e. robots) and technological singularity. 

As such, most academic research is extremely out of touch with reality and what probably 99% of people around the world actually experience day by day. Scientist and academic researchers / staff / etc have an obligation to do better. After all, at the very least we are primarily being supported and paid through public funds. 

## Sounds, expression, machines, and movement 

We need a great movement and platform for improving what the culture and development of science is. Remember, science is a culture and a machine that was created by humans. It is not perfect and it needs to be consistently challenged to remain relevant and useful.
