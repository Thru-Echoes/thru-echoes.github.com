# Thru-Echoes: Oliver Muellerklein

This is a blog site where I decide to post thoughts and examples of data science, mathematical modeling, machine learning, and scientific research in computational ecology (and related fields). I am using the *Minimal Mistakes* blog framework that is described below.

## 1 This Site

I am a first year PhD student with Wayne Getz at UC Berkeley.

My work is two-fold: research and software development -

#### 1.1 Computational Research

i) I work on computational ecology - and related domain - research with experience in developing agent-based and population-based modeling with *Genetic Algorithms* in evolutionary-ecology systems, *Population Viability Analysis*, and machine-learning approaches to *Species Distribution Modeling* with future probabilities.

#### 1.2 Software Development

ii) I also develop a range of software and script - namely for *Javascript and R*. I am working on developing web applications and server-side (including HPC) capabilities of the Nova modeling software. I am very interested in the increased accessibility with browser-based modeling approaches in education as well as research domains with little to no programming experience.

See a [live version of Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) hosted on GitHub.

#### 2.2 Getting Started

Minimal Mistakes takes advantage of Sass and data files to make customizing easier. These features require [Jekyll 2.x](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/releases/tag/2.1.3) and will not work with older versions of Jekyll.

To learn how to install and use this theme check out the [Setup Guide](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/theme-setup/) for more information.
